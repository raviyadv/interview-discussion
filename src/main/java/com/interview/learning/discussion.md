# Language fundamental

1. What is Java Language ?
    > OOPS language - follows oops principles
   > HeapArea - memory area used to store class objects when an application is running on jvm
   > Class - template for objects with similar properties
   > Object - instance of class.has identity, state and behaviour. state is stored in varibales, behaviour is identified by methods and identity is internally used by JVM to uniquely identify each object. 
   > Method area - class meta-data storage, static method, static variable
   > High Level
   > JDK, JRE, JVM

2. Identifier 
   > any name call identifier - a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, $  
   Access modifier, keywords, camelCase naming convention, class name - noun, method - verb
3. Keywords - 53 - literal - true, false, null - are the words which are defined at language level.
4. Datatypes
   > every data has type and to define those type java has predefined primitive(primary and defined at language level) data types.
   >  byte-1 byte, short-2, int-4, long-8, char-2, float-4, double-8, boolean-1 bit
5. Array - it's a index collection of homogenous data elements. - one dimensions
   >  sum of two 3*3 dimensions arrays, multiple of two 3*3 dimensions arrays, print * pattern in jig jag form, reverse array by using only one array
   > practice foreach two dimension array.
6. A a = new A(); - new operator is creating A class object by calling default constructor whose reference is stored in A class reference variable a using = operator.
7. types of variable - instance, static, local - primitive type and reference type
